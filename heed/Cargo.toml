# The `serde` feature makes some types serializable,
# like the `EnvOpenOptions` struct.
default = ["serde", "serde-bincode", "serde-json"]
serde = ["bitflags/serde", "dep:serde"]

# The #MDB_NOTLS flag is automatically set on Env opening,
# RoTxn and RoCursors implements the Send trait. This allows the
# user to move RoTxns and RoCursors between threads as read transactions
# will no more use thread local storage and will tie reader locktable
# slots to #MDB_txn objects instead of to threads.
#
# According to the LMDB documentation, when this feature is not enabled:
# A thread can only use one transaction at a time, plus any child
# transactions. Each transaction belongs to one thread. [...]
# The #MDB_NOTLS flag changes this for read-only transactions.
#
# And a #MDB_BAD_RSLOT error will be thrown when multiple read
# transactions exists on the same thread

# Whether to tell LMDB to use POSIX semaphores during compilation
# (instead of the default, which are System V semaphores).
# POSIX semaphores are required for Apple's App Sandbox on iOS & macOS,
# and are possibly faster and more appropriate for single-process use.
# There are tradeoffs for both POSIX and SysV semaphores; which you
# should look into before enabling this feature. Also, see here:
# <https://github.com/LMDB/lmdb/blob/3947014aed7ffe39a79991fa7fb5b234da47ad1a/libraries/liblmdb/lmdb.h#L46-L69>

# These features configure the MDB_IDL_LOGN macro, which determines
# the size of the free and dirty page lists (and thus the amount of memory
# allocated when opening an LMDB environment in read-write mode).
#
# Each feature defines MDB_IDL_LOGN as the value in the name of the feature.
# That means these features are mutually exclusive, and you must not specify
# more than one at the same time (or the crate will fail to compile).
#
# For more information on the motivation for these features (and their effect),
# see https://github.com/mozilla/lmdb/pull/2.

# Setting this enables you to use keys longer than 511 bytes. The exact limit
# is computed by LMDB at compile time. You can find the exact value by calling
# Env::max_key_size(). This value varies by architecture.
#
# Example max key sizes:
#   - Apple M1 (ARM64): 8126 bytes
#   - Apple Intel (AMD64): 1982 bytes
#   - Linux Intel (AMD64): 1982 bytes
#
# Setting this also enables you to use values larger than 511 bytes when using
# a Database with the DatabaseFlags::DUP_SORT flag.
#
# This builds LMDB with the -DMDB_MAXKEYSIZE=0 option.
#
# Note: If you are moving database files between architectures then your longest
# stored key must fit within the smallest limit of all architectures used. For
# example, if you are moving databases between Apple M1 and Apple Intel
# computers then you need to keep your keys within the smaller 1982 byte limit.
